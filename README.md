# A2 3d Figures

Assignment No 2 for the computer graphics course. Modify previous code examples to render the following:

- A 3D pyramid with a pentagon base as in Figure 1. The pyramid has to rotate around the axis [0.1, 1.0, 0.2].
- A [Scutoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutoid), as in Figure 2. It has to rotate around the axis [-0.4, 1.0, 0.1].
- An Ochtahedron, as in Figure 3. It has to rotate around the axis [0, 1, 0]; it also has to move up and down within the canvas: it moves up until it reaches the top of the canvas, then it moves down until it reaches the bottom, and then it repeats.

Rubric:

1. The canvas was adjusted to include the 3 figures. The pyramid at the left of the canvas, the scutoid at the center, and the octahedron at the right. *Complete, although the figures are not placed were instructed*
2. Created an independent function for each figure. *Complete*
3. Defined the vertex, color, and index information for each figure. *Complete, although the scutoid had some errors*
4. Each face of each figure was rendered with a different color. *Complete*
5. The figures were transformed correctly. *Incomplete*

**NOTES**

1. The figures were not placed, and were not moving as instructed.
2. The scutoid was not rendered correctly. Some of the faces were incorrectly placed.
